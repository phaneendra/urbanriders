# Urban Riders Build in Public: Log

## ---------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Rules

- I will code for at least an hour every day
- I will log my progress every day in this (Log)[LOG.md] file
- If I code at work, that time won't count towards the 1h commitment.
- I will push code to GitHub every day so that anyone can see my progress.
- I will update the (Log)[LOG.md] with the day's progress and provide a link so that others can see my progress.
- The time spent doing tutorials, online courses and other similar resources will NOT count towards the 1h commitment.
