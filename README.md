## Known Issues

A list of things not working right now:

1. ~Authentication (use email)~
2. ~[Next.js 13: Client side navigation does not update head](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/issues/42414)~
3. [Cannot use opengraph-image.tsx inside catch-all routes](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/issues/48162)
4. All color variables from radix are included using windy-radix-pallete make it to use only specific pallete
5. Fix warning displayed using duration arbitary utility class

## Why not tRPC, Turborepo or X?

I might add this later. For now, I want to see how far we can get using Next.js only.

If you have some suggestions, feel free to create an issue.

## Running Locally

- Install dependencies using pnpm:

```sh
pnpm install
```

- Copy `.env.example` to `.env.local` and update the variables.

```sh
cp .env.example .env.local
```

- Start the development server:

```sh
pnpm dev
```

To test the payments flow, follow these steps:

1. Sign up for Stripe for free at `https://stripe.com/`
2. Install the stripe CLI

3. Run in local
   `stripe listen --forward-to localhost:5173/stripe`
   or
   register the webhook endpointâ€™s URL `https://<CONVEX DEPLOYMENT>.convex.site/stripe` using the Webhooks section in the Developer Dashboard

4. Copy the "Your webhook signing secret" from the output of the listen command, and set it as `STRIPE_WEBHOOKS_SECRET` environment variable on your Convex dashboard
5. Copy your test secret API key from the code example on `https://stripe.com/docs/checkout/quickstart` and set it as `STRIPE_API_KEY` environment variable on your Convex dashboard

You can then use the test credit card details to go through the payment flow, see `https://stripe.com/docs/checkout/quickstart#testing`
Test credit card for India : 4000003560000008

Our Rides

The Club is too big and varied for us to all meet together and go for a ride, so, naturally, the Members have formed many groups of their own to ride and socialise. It is daunting for new members to find out what is going on. Why not make it easy for new (and old!) members, and describe the group(s) you are in? Any Club Member can request Admin or Volunteers to create a Group Channel. Tell us where you meet and how you communicate (Facebook, WhatsApp, Messenger, etc.). You can use the website itself or group specific Discord channel to send messages to other Group members, or just point them to your preferred communications channel.

Explore all BCC Groups Note: Groups are only visible to logged-in Club Members.
