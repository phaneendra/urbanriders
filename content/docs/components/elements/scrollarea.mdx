          Legibility describes how easily individual characters can be
          distinguished from one another. It is described by Walter Tracy as “the
          quality of being decipherable and recognisable”. For instance, if a “b”
          and an “h”, or a “3” and an “8”, are difficult to distinguish at small
          sizes, this is a problem of legibility.

        <Text as="p">
          Typographers are concerned with legibility insofar as it is their job to
          select the correct font to use. Brush Script is an example of a font
          containing many characters that might be difficult to distinguish. The
          selection of cases influences the legibility of typography because using
          only uppercase letters (all-caps) reduces legibility.

## API Reference

This component inherits props from the Radix [ScrollArea.Root](/primitives/docs/components/scroll-area#root) and [ScrollArea.Viewport](/primitives/docs/components/scroll-area#viewport) parts. It supports [common margin props](/themes/docs/theme/layout#margin-props).

## Examples

### Size

Use the `size` prop to control the size of the scrollbar handles.

{<ComponentExample scroll={false}>

  <Flex direction="column" gap="2">
    <ScrollArea
      size="1"
      type="always"
      scrollbars="horizontal"
      style={{ width: 300, height: 12 }}
    >
      <Box style={{ width: 800, height: 1 }} />
    </ScrollArea>

    <ScrollArea
      size="2"
      type="always"
      scrollbars="horizontal"
      style={{ width: 350, height: 16 }}
    >
      <Box style={{ width: 900, height: 1 }} />
    </ScrollArea>

    <ScrollArea
      size="3"
      type="always"
      scrollbars="horizontal"
      style={{ width: 400, height: 20 }}
    >
      <Box style={{ width: 1000, height: 1 }} />
    </ScrollArea>

  </Flex>
</ComponentExample>}

```jsx live=true
<Flex direction="column" gap="2">
  <ScrollArea
    size="1"
    type="always"
    scrollbars="horizontal"
    style={{ width: 300, height: 12 }}
  >
    <Box style={{ width: 800, height: 1 }} />
  </ScrollArea>

  <ScrollArea
    size="2"
    type="always"
    scrollbars="horizontal"
    style={{ width: 350, height: 16 }}
  >
    <Box style={{ width: 900, height: 1 }} />
  </ScrollArea>

  <ScrollArea
    size="3"
    type="always"
    scrollbars="horizontal"
    style={{ width: 400, height: 20 }}
  >
    <Box style={{ width: 1000, height: 1 }} />
  </ScrollArea>
</Flex>
```

### Radius

Use the `radius` prop to assign a specific radius to the handles, ignoring the global theme.

{<ComponentExample scroll={false}>

<Flex direction="column" gap="3">
  <ScrollArea
    radius="none"
    size="3"
    type="always"
    scrollbars="horizontal"
    style={{ width: 350, height: 20 }}
  >
    <Box style={{ width: 800, height: 1 }} />
  </ScrollArea>
  <ScrollArea
    radius="small"
    size="3"
    type="always"
    scrollbars="horizontal"
    style={{ width: 350, height: 20 }}
  >
    <Box style={{ width: 800, height: 1 }} />
  </ScrollArea>
  <ScrollArea
    radius="medium"
    size="3"
    type="always"
    scrollbars="horizontal"
    style={{ width: 350, height: 20 }}
  >
    <Box style={{ width: 800, height: 1 }} />
  </ScrollArea>
  <ScrollArea
    radius="large"
    size="3"
    type="always"
    scrollbars="horizontal"
    style={{ width: 350, height: 20 }}
  >
    <Box style={{ width: 800, height: 1 }} />
  </ScrollArea>
  <ScrollArea
    radius="full"
    size="3"
    type="always"
    scrollbars="horizontal"
    style={{ width: 350, height: 20 }}
  >
    <Box style={{ width: 800, height: 1 }} />
  </ScrollArea>
</Flex>
</ComponentExample>}

```jsx live=true
<Flex direction="column" gap="3">
  <ScrollArea
    radius="none"
    size="3"
    type="always"
    scrollbars="horizontal"
    style={{ width: 350, height: 20 }}
  >
    <Box style={{ width: 800, height: 1 }} />
  </ScrollArea>
  <ScrollArea
    radius="small"
    size="3"
    type="always"

  <ScrollArea
    radius="full"
    size="3"
    type="always"
    scrollbars="horizontal"
    style={{ width: 350, height: 20 }}
  >
    <Box style={{ width: 800, height: 1 }} />
  </ScrollArea>
</Flex>

### Scollbars

Use the `scrollbars` prop to limit scrollable axes.

{<ComponentExample scroll={false}>

  <Flex columns="2" gap="2">
    <ScrollArea type="always" scrollbars="vertical" style={{ height: 150 }}>
      <Flex direction="column" gap="4" className="p-2 pr-8">
