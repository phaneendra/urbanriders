# Breakpoints

<Description>
  Built-in breakpoints allow you to easily build adaptive layouts.
</Description>

## Available sizes

Each breakpoint matches a fixed screen width. Values are `min-width` based and apply when the screen width is equal or greater.

<ThemesBreakpointsTable />

## Usage

Most component size and layout props will accept an additional `Responsive` object shape for modifying the given prop across breakpoints.

Each size maps to a corresponding key, the value of each will be applied when the screen size is greater than or equal to the named breakpoint.

```jsx
<Heading
  size={{
    initial: "3",
    md: "5",
    xl: "7",
  }}
/>
```
